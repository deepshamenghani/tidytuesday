In this post, I will analyse the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/) Australia Numbats dataset. 

The data this week comes from the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/). Thanks to Di Cook for [preparing this week's dataset](https://github.com/numbats/numbats-tidytuesday)!
