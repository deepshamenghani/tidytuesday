In this post, I will analyse the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/) Art history dataset.

[Arthistory data package](https://saralemus7.github.io/arthistory/) contains both artist-level and work-level data that was collected along with variables regarding the artists\' demographics and numeric metrics for describing how much space they or their work took up in each edition of each textbook - Janson’s History of Art and Gardner’s Art Through the Ages, two of the most popular art history textbooks used in the American education system.
